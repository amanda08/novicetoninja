This application maps the mastery of skills as specified by the user with a graphical interface.

Created following the [Rails Tutorial](http://www.ruby.railstutorial.org) by Michael Hartl.

Creating this application will be just one of the activities I'll add to my own *Novice to Ninja* profile when it's all completed!
