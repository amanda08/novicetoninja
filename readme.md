# README

This application maps the mastery of skills as specified by the user with a graphical interface.

Created following the [Rails Tutorial](http://www.ruby.railstutorial.org) by Michael Hartl.

* Ruby version 2.0.0

Creating this application will be just one of the activities I'll add to my own *Novice to Ninja* profile when it's all completed!

Created by [Amanda Neumann](mailto:amandaneumann@me.com).

## TODO
Add a unique / customisable username using the 'forgery' gem.

## NOTES
This is a work in progress and my very first app! Currently being deployed to Heroku: [https://novicetoninja.herokuapp.com/](https://novicetoninja.herokuapp.com/).
